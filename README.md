# Number-Shooting-Game
A very raw and simple game I whipped up in a couple of days. The aim of the game is to shoot circles that appear on the screen before they disappear. The game is far from complete and the code can do with being cleaned up so I may come back to this. Aim with the mouse and shoot by clicking. Reload by pressing 'r'.
